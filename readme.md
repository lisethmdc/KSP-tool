# Hohman transfer orbit Î”v

**This tool is for Kerbal Space Program game.**

***Script use ES6, user needs run script through server.***



This is a tool designed to calculate the required deltaV for a Hohman transfer.

Given the initial and final orbit radii it will plot the two orbits and the Hohman transfer trajectory as well as calculate the required deltaV for both burns.
